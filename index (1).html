<h1>History</h1>
The QWERTY keyboard that we use today is attributed to Christoper Latham Sholes. This American inventor first showed off the keyboard on July 1, 1874. Sholes organised the original layout alphabetically.
<h1>Definition</h1>
A computer keyboard is an input device that allows a person to enter letters, numbers, and other symbols (together, these are called characters) into a computer. It is one of the most used input devices for computers. Using a keyboard is often called typing.
<h1>Types</h1>
<p>1. Mainframe Computers: Early mainframe computers in the 1950s and 1960s had custom keyboards designed for data entry and programming.</p>
<p>2. Microcomputers: As personal computers emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, keyboards became more standardized. The IBM Model M keyboard, with its distinctive buckling spring keys, became iconic during this era.<p/>

<p>3. Membrane Keyboards: Many early home computers featured membrane keyboards, which were cheaper to produce but less tactile.</p>

<p>4. Laptop Keyboards: The development of laptops in the 1980s led to the creation of compact, integrated keyboards. These keyboards are still widely used in portable devices.</p>

<p>5. Mechanical Keyboards Revival: Mechanical keyboards, known for their tactile and audible feedback, made a comeback in the late 20th century and are popular among enthusiasts today.</p>

<p>6. Wireless and Ergonomic Keyboards: Recent years have seen the rise of wireless and ergonomic keyboards, catering to various user preferences and needs.</p>

<p>7. Touchscreen Keyboards: With the advent of smartphones and tablets, virtual, touchscreen keyboards have become ubiquitous, changing the way we interact with computers and devices.</p>

<h2>Types of Keyboard Layout</h2>
<p>1. QWERTY - is a keyboard layout for Latin-script alphabets. The name comes from the order of the first six keys on the top left letter row of the keyboard. The QWERTY design is based on a layout created for the Sholes and Glidden typewriter and sold to E. Remington and Sons in 1873.</p>

<p>2. AZERTY - is a specific layout for the characters of the Latin alphabet on typewriter keys and computer keyboards. It is used in France and Belgium, although each of these countries has its own national variation on the layout.</p>

<p>3. QWERTZ - is a typewriter and keyboard layout widely used in Central Europe. The QWERTZ layout is the normal keyboard layout in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It is also fairly widely used in Czechia, Slovakia and other parts of Central Europe.</p>

<p>4. Dvorak -  is a keyboard layout for English patented in 1936 by August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, as a faster and more ergonomic alternative to the QWERTY layout. Dvorak proponents claim that it requires less finger motion and as a result reduces errors, increases typing speed, reduces repetitive strain injuries, or is simply more comfortable than QWERTY.</p>
